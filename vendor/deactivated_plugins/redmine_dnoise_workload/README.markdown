### D-Noise Workload Redmine Plugin ala FINE

A quick set of mods to the basic Workload plugin, which include

* localized into english (config/locales/en.yml)
* layout modifications
* de-logo-fied (not that we don't like the logos, but we like our pages to look like other Redmine pages)
* default to no users selected when you first land on the page (to reduce load times)

#### To Do

* Look at implementing Redmine Group selector to view workload by Department/Group
